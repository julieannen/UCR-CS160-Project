# Phase 3: Graph Update

## Introduction

So far the graph has been static: load once, run an algorithm, exit. Real systems receive a stream of edge updates while queries are still running. Phase 3 builds the smallest version of that pipeline: a single **producer** reads update requests from a trace file, and `N` **consumer** threads apply them to an in-memory graph, communicating through a **concurrent queue** that you will implement.

The graph in this phase is stored as out-neighbor adjacency lists. Define a small record for each out-edge:

```cpp
struct Edge { uint32_t dst; int weight; };
```

and store the graph as `std::vector<std::vector<Edge>>`. Applying one ADD is just a `push_back` on row `src`. Two consumers updating different rows do not collide; two consumers updating the same row do. Each source row therefore carries its own mutex.

## Requirements

Implement three pieces and wire them together.

1. **Concurrent queue.** A blocking, unbounded queue with `Push(T)`, `Pop() -> std::optional<T>`, and `Close()`. Use one `std::mutex` plus one `std::condition_variable`. `Pop` blocks while the queue is empty and open; once `Close()` has been called and the queue is drained, `Pop` returns `std::nullopt` so each consumer can exit cleanly.

2. **Graph and apply path.** Hold the adjacency list as `std::vector<std::vector<Edge>>` plus a parallel `std::vector<std::mutex>`, one mutex per source vertex. Applying an ADD: lock `locks[src]`, `push_back({dst, weight})`, unlock.

3. **Producer + consumers.** First, **pre-load** `initial.txt` into the adjacency list and **pre-parse** `updates.txt` into memory: an in-order list of ADD records and a parallel list of `D` markers (each marker remembers its position in the ADD stream and the sleep duration). Both happen *before* timing starts and are not counted toward the measurement.

   Then spawn `N` consumer threads that loop on `Pop` and apply each request, and have the single producer iterate the in-memory lists. Two request shapes:
   - `ADD <src> <dst> <weight>`: push to the queue.
   - `D <ms>`: the producer itself sleeps for `ms` milliseconds before continuing. **`D` is not enqueued and not consumed.** It models a slow producer.

   When the producer reaches the end of the in-memory list, it calls `Close()`, then joins the consumers.

**Correctness.** After every consumer has joined, the per-vertex weight sums computed from the in-memory adjacency list, summed over all vertices and reduced mod `10^9 + 7`, must equal the same quantity computed from the original full edge list. See *Testing & Verification*.

## Hints

### Concurrent queue

Two things worth noticing as you design the queue:

- `Pop` waits on the condition variable with a predicate that checks **both** "queue is non-empty" and "queue is closed". Waiting only on `!empty` deadlocks: if the producer closes the queue while a consumer is parked, that consumer never wakes and never returns end-of-stream.
- A successful `Push` only needs to wake one waiter (`notify_one`). `Close()` must wake every waiter (`notify_all`), because each parked consumer needs to observe the closed state and return `nullopt` independently.

### Producer loop

The producer walks two pre-parsed arrays in lockstep: `adds[]` and `delays[]`, where each `delays[k] = (i, ms)` says "sleep `ms` ms right before pushing `adds[i]`". Sketch:

```
di = 0
for i in [0, adds.size()):
    while di < delays.size() and delays[di].first == i:
        sleep_for(delays[di].second)
        di += 1
    queue.Push(adds[i])
flush any trailing delays past the last ADD
queue.Close()
```

### Consumer loop and termination

```
while (auto req = queue.Pop()) apply(*req);
```

`Pop` returns `nullopt` exactly once per consumer (after `Close()` and the queue is empty), which lets the loop exit. The producer joins all consumers after closing.

### Measurement window

Time **only** the producer-consumer phase. The graph load and the `updates.txt` pre-parse are done first and are *not* counted. Spawn the consumers *before* starting the clock so they are already parked on the empty queue when timing begins; start the clock right before the producer begins iterating `adds[]` / `delays[]`, and stop it after every consumer has joined.

## Testing & Verification

Download `initial.txt` and `updates.txt` from the [shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H65CH1qnzg-x7N4ZBQGPpADRuLLxjh2a?usp=sharing). The trace was produced by splitting a weighted edge list into an initial / update partition with five `D` entries interleaved at random positions.

**Weight-sum check.** After all updates have been applied, compute

```
S = (sum over v of sum over e in adj[v] of e.weight) mod (10^9 + 7)
```

For the provided dataset, `S` must equal **`834418737`**.

## Discussion

Answer the following in your development journal.

Run the pipeline at `N = 1` and `N = 4` on the same trace, and report the wall time of each. Which is faster? Explain the result: where does the time go in the slower version? why?

## Bonus Task (extra 3 pt)

Based on your analysis in *Discussion*, propose one change to the queue or its API that would let the four-thread version beat the single-thread baseline. *Hint: which lock is on the hot path of every single request, and how could you take it less often?*

Implement your proposal, then re-run the four-thread pipeline on the same trace, report the performance, and give your analysis.

For bonus task, please also present your solution to me in person during the lab section or office hours within the next two weeks. I may ask about the details of your algorithm and your performance analysis, similar to what you have done in your journal.
